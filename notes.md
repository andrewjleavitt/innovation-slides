# HI!

## So, this is a little different.

### I think that's ok.

One of the things that I hope for with this group is that it can serve as a training ground for each of us to grow our careers. It should serve as a place where we can try things that are a little different. Bounce ideas off of one another. Try to figure things out.

## The best place to fail is among friends.

During this hour, the third thursday of each month between noon and one pm when everybody is stuffing their faces with tacos I hope we aren’t afraid to say the wrong thing.

## Don’t be afraid to mess up!

That’s what I want to talk about today. 
# Messing up.

### Why talk about messing up?

I’ll tell you what I think. I think we are able to do what we are doing and that we are able to continue to do the things we are doing every day already. That’s why you are eating from a Rubio’s Taco bar catered to this room. TruHearing has confidence that you can do the job already. I submit that in our company

#### just doing our job is not probably enough.

## We need to innovate.

I know what you are all thinking.

### I thought only Tommy gets to innovate.
now you are thinking
#### - wait, sometimes Jarem is allowed to innovate.

This is absolutely not true. I think the culture of our company depends on us innovating.

We often hear about small companies being the only place where innovation can happen. In truth - innovation can happen at any company, big or small, and it can happen at any level within that company. We only hear about the small companies that make it. But even these companies can run into problems as they grow. The rate of innovations slows down. They become just like every other cubicle laden, middle-management driven company out there - and it all stems from one basic fundamental problem - innovative ideas are indistinguishable from dumb ideas. That’s right:

## Innovative ideas are indistinguishable from dumb ideas

If something seems like a clearly good idea, it is also an obvious idea. So everyone is doing it! The big ideas that fundamentally change the status quo usually have fatal-seeming flaws that keep (almost) everyone from pursuing them: 

## It’s impossible. 
## It’s in poor taste. 
## No one would want it. 
## You can’t make money doing it. 
## It’s too expensive to build.

The best track record of repeated technical innovation in high tech is the collective Silicon Valley startup scene. And guess what — 9 out of 10 VC-backed startups fail. The absolute best-of-the-best, most profitable VCs? Maybe a 25% success rate.

If you can tell the brilliant from the baloney even one out of four times, you are at the top of the game. I encourage you to go into investing and print money! For mere mortals — it’s more like one in ten or worse.

## So, what does all of this mean for us?
## What is stopping the managers of TruHearing having a culture of innovation?

this is a real question. could be
- ideas
- lack of resources
- do we have company support?
- always a fire to put out?
- IT won’t get me a report?

## I think it is you and me.

It is the engineers, the managers, the PMs actually working on the products, and how we’re affected by failure.

Have you ever had the experience of working on a project for six months, a year, multiple years… only to see it get shelved? How did you feel afterwards? Ready to dive in on the next project?

### How many of you remember
- money buckets
- appointment letters
- wait - is t3 supposed to fax?
- incontact
- Domo
- clinic ranks
- any report out of t3 ever
- duplicate clinic logins
- surveys
- notifications
- clinic confirmations
- MONEY BUCKETS
- February 4th?!?!?!
- marketing attribution
- exchanges
- returns
- wait, what does L&D mean?

These projects at some point were each brilliant and at other points complete dogs/failures

Some of them have grown into usefulness and others have been discarded and still others we wish we could discard. But the point is that I was directly involved in each of these projects  and they were meant to grow the business, help with patient experience, create some efficiency, etc… When these projects fail it is hard to trust that the next project will mean something - that I’m not wasting  another 6 months of my life on something that has no value.

As individuals, we have no portfolio strategy — so those 10% odds are no longer palatable. When we fail, most rational people respond by trying to avoid dumb ideas and pick smart bets with clear impact the next time. People who happen to have a hit in their first few tries are even more vulnerable to the belief that they have to succeed every time (and take it harder when subsequent failures inevitably occur.) And that’s it — the dead-end for innovation.

The self-same employees who are innovating and taking risks with you today are going to become risk averse and careful once they start failing — and sooner or later, they (and you) will fail.

## So, now what?

	### Permission to fail
“Permission to fail” is also a tricky concept. You don’t want to build your company with people who don’t care if they fail or not. High standards, thirst for impact, “fire in the belly” — those same qualities that make us punish ourselves harshly for failing — those are precisely the traits that make amazing teammates who will put their heart into every project and give you the best chances of success. Those are the people you want in your foxhole — not people who’ve had that spark put out!

### Fail Fast
You can (and should) make every effort to fail as fast as possible to minimize the human costs of failure. But that tactic is limited by how long it realistically takes to prove or disprove the kind of ideas you work on. Even ruthlessly optimizing project definition proof of concept, failing fast can still take months or years, especially if your innovation is technical, rather than product- or market-based.

### “well, we don’t penalize failure.”
You don’t have to. Even if you don’t fire employees or dock their bonuses for working on a failed project, the kind of people who care deeply and passionately about their work will penalize themselves, with feelings of shame and loss.

#### nurture the spirit of innovation: hire people who hate to fail, and build a culture that picks people up, dusts them off, and encourages them to try again when failure occurs.

### How do we help people move past failure?
Success means different things to different people: a soaring stock price or their name in lights or the satisfaction of making an impact. None of those are available when a project fails, so you can’t make someone whole on their opportunity cost. Luckily, you can mitigate the emotional costs of failure — and those turn out to be more significant to most people. You do it by reassuring people that failure is a natural consequence of being bold, that they are capable of greatness, and that most successes come from failing and trying again.

Unfortunately, you can’t wait until a project fails to come up with these sentiments. Not much rings more hollow than “Attaboy! We’ll get ‘em next time!” at the project’s cancellation. It’s the last thing anyone on the team wants to hear, let alone believe. And they’ve also got to hear it from each other — their teammates and peers — not just the boss who wants to send them on the next suicide mission.

### bake resilience into your culture from the very outset
- “Move fast and break things” - Facebook

No company writes “Move slow” on the walls. But if you just write “Move fast” by itself, your company will eventually slow down anyway. Moving fast comes at a cost — the cost of making mistakes. If you don’t signal loudly that you are prepared to pay that price, your team will slow down on their own out of completely natural obedience to the rule so universal no one needs to write it on the walls: “Don’t screw up.”

This isn’t to say that your company should be a consequence-free environment. You should have zero tolerance for ethical transgressions (say, user privacy violations, or creating a hostile work environment). You also need to part ways with individuals who don’t have the skills to be successful and aren’t improving.

But you can and should shape the way your employees talk to each other about mistakes, and that starts with you. Posters and slogans like Facebook’s are symbolic reminders, but they don’t do the actual heavy lifting of demonstrating conviction. 

### If all you do is hang posters, expect your employees to receive them with justifiable cynicism. 

What sets the tone is the way company leaders talk about their own failures, acknowledging what happened and sharing how they and the company are stronger for the lessons they learned. It takes courage and vulnerability to talk about your own shortcomings, and ultimately, that’s what will make a difference to the people who trust you and follow you.

Getting up in front of your team and talking about things you got wrong is terrifying. But if you want your team to be bold, it starts with you.

Thank you.
